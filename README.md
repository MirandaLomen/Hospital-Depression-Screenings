# Hospital Depression Screenings

The goal of this project was to analyze hospital patient demographics of patients that received a depression screening from the years 2012-2017 in order to assess where to allocate more mental health resources. The hospital organization wants the data provided organized based on gender, age, race, and marital status per year.
